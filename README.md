# Comp-Graphics-and-Visualizations

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
* This project and course have given me a lot of insight into how computer graphics work on a fairly fundamental level. I have learned how to apply linear algebra to create three-dimensional objects, display textures on objects, create and move a camera object, and apply       lighting to a scene.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
* Starting with my reference photo, I broke all of the objects in the image into basic shapes. Next, I set up a basic scene with a moving camera and some simple objects that would be the foundation for my work later. I then created the vertices and indices for these basic shapes and arranged them in my scene. For textures, I used a photo of my sheet as the ground plane and made simple solid or tiled textures for the rest of the objects. Finally, I added a light source to my scene.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
* The best way to approach any complex project is to break it down into more managable pieces. This tactic will make my work easier, faster, and more efficient overall than if I were to dive in without a plan. Not only is it applicable to computer graphics and design, but any project of any size that can be broken into steps.
  
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
* I learned a lot about OpenGL and how to apply development strategies from previous courses in new ways. One technique I got a lot of experience with was reading through and understanding example code. In previous courses, the information in my books and resources was enough to make me understand what the example code did and how it worked, but this course was more complicated and information dense than the others, and I had to dedicate a lot of my time to reading and messing with example code before I had any idea what it was doing. This was a valuable experience for me and improved my ability to analyze code with minimal context.
  
How did iteration factor into your development?
* Iteration was used in my development several times; one example being the marker creation loop in the myRender() function. Both the bodies and caps of the three markers are created in this for loop, with even values of i corresponding to marker bodies and odd values corresponding to the marker caps. This loop limited the amount of code I had to write and made it easy for me to change things like marker positions and colors. Another way iteration factored into my development is in the rendering loop for the spiral binding of my sketchbook. Each one is incrementally moved down the sketchbook, so I didn't need to translate each one manually.
  
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
* My understanding of OpenGL has been refined through the milestones. With each one I explored new and difficult tasks that gave me the skills I needed to complete the final project.
  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
* The skills I have practiced in breaking down complex problems, analyzing and testing code, object-oriented programming, and iteration will be useful for my future course projects. My hope is that I will continue to be challenged and to improve these skills in my future education.
  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
* One field of computer science I'm particularly interested in is game design, to which computational graphics and visualizations are very important. If I continue to practice working with OpenGL and higher level programs like Blender and Unreal Engine, I will develop this valuable skill and become a more promising candidate to employers in my ideal career.
