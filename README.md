# Comp-Graphics-and-Visualizations

* How do I approach designing software?
    What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
      This project and course have given me a lot of insight into how computer graphics work on a fairly fundamental level. I've leaned how to apply linear algebra to create three-dimensional objects, display textures on objects, create and move a camera object, and apply       lighting to a scene.
    What design process did you follow for your project work?
      Starting with my reference photo, I broke all of the objects in the image into basic shapes. Next, I set up a basic scene with a moving camera and some simple objects that would be the foundation for my work later. I then created the vertices and indices for these basic shapes and arranged them in my scene. For textures, I used a photo of my sheet as the ground plane and made simple solid or tiled textures for the rest of the objects. Finally, I added a light source to my scene.
    How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
